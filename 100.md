Digital Collectibles
--------------------

`draft` `optional`

Based on https://thebitcoinmanual.com/articles/nostr-approach-nfts.

## Summary

This NIP proposes a standardized approach for creating, managing, and transferring Digital Collectibles on the Nostr protocol. Digital Collectibles, also known as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), are unique digital items that can represent ownership of various assets, including art, music, in-game items, and more.

## Motivation

The Nostr protocol offers a decentralized and censorship-resistant platform for creating and managing Digital Collectibles. By leveraging Nostr's unique event-based infrastructure, we can establish a standardized framework for Digital Collectibles that is secure, interoperable, and user-friendly.

## Specification

**1. Digital Collectible Event Type**

A new event type, `DigitalCollectible`, is introduced to represent Digital Collectibles on Nostr. This event type will contain the following fields:

- `name`: The name of the Digital Collectible
- `description`: A brief description of the Digital Collectible
- `image`: A URL or hash of the Digital Collectible's image
- `metadata`: Additional metadata associated with the Digital Collectible, such as artist name, collection name, and attributes

**2. Digital Collectible Creation (mint)**

To create a Digital Collectible, a user broadcasts a `DigitalCollectible` event to the Nostr network. The event must be signed by the user's private key to prove ownership of the Digital Collectible.

**3. Digital Collectible Transfer**

**3.1 Transfer Process**

Transferring a Digital Collectible from one user to another is a straightforward process that involves broadcasting a `DigitalCollectibleTransfer` event to the Nostr network. This event includes the following information:

* **Digital Collectible Identifier:** A unique identifier that identifies the specific Digital Collectible being transferred. This identifier could be a hash of the Digital Collectible's metadata or a serial number assigned by the creator.

* **Recipient's Public Key:** The public key of the user who will receive the Digital Collectible. This public key is used to verify the recipient's identity and ensure that the Digital Collectible is transferred to the correct person.

* **Signature:** A digital signature generated by the current owner's private key. This signature proves that the current owner has the authority to transfer the Digital Collectible and prevents unauthorized transfers.

Once the `DigitalCollectibleTransfer` event is broadcast, it is propagated throughout the Nostr network. Upon receiving the event, other nodes on the network validate the signature and update their records to reflect the new ownership of the Digital Collectible.

**3.2 Selling Process**

Selling a Digital Collectible involves a two-step process:

1. **Negotiation and Payment:** The seller and buyer negotiate the price of the Digital Collectible and agree on a payment method. Payment can be made in any form that is mutually agreeable, such as cryptocurrency, fiat currency, or even bartering.

2. **Digital Collectible Transfer:** Once the payment has been completed, the seller broadcasts a `DigitalCollectibleTransfer` event to the Nostr network, transferring ownership of the Digital Collectible to the buyer. The event includes the buyer's public key and the seller's signature to finalize the transfer.

In some cases, third-party marketplaces can facilitate the buying and selling of Digital Collectibles. These marketplaces provide a platform for sellers to list their Digital Collectibles, buyers to browse and purchase them, and escrow services to ensure that transactions are secure and fair.


**4. Digital Collectible Management**

Users can manage their Digital Collectibles by viewing their event history on the Nostr network. They can also transfer or sell their Digital Collectibles to other users.

**5. Digital Collectible Marketplaces**

Third-party applications can be developed to facilitate the buying, selling, and trading of Digital Collectibles. These marketplaces can utilize Nostr's event-based infrastructure to enable seamless interactions between users and their Digital Collectibles.

**6. Digital Collectible Security**

Digital Collectibles on Nostr are secured by the protocol's underlying cryptography. The use of private keys and digital signatures ensures that ownership of Digital Collectibles is verifiable and tamper-proof.

**7. Digital Collectible Interoperability**

Digital Collectibles on Nostr can be interoperable with other platforms that support Digital Collectibles. This is possible by using Nostr's event format to represent Digital Collectibles in a standardized way.

**8. Digital Collectible User Experience**

User-friendly applications can be developed to simplify the creation, management, and transfer of Digital Collectibles. These applications can abstract away the underlying complexity of the Nostr protocol, making Digital Collectibles accessible to a wider audience.

**Conclusion**

The proposed `DigitalCollectible` event type provides a standardized and secure approach for creating, managing, and transferring Digital Collectibles on the Nostr protocol. By leveraging Nostr's decentralized and censorship-resistant nature, we can foster a thriving ecosystem for Digital Collectibles that empowers users and promotes innovation.
